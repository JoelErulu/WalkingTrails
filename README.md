### Description

The Walking Trails App is a mobile application designed to enhance the walking experience on Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) trails through interactive and educational content focused on fitness, health, and wellness. The app is accessible via QR codes placed on signs along the trails. By scanning a QR code, users are directed to the app, where they can access instructional videos, trail maps, exercise guides, and nutrition information, among other features.
